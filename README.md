# SPatial Analysis for single Cell (Spac)

Spac is a scalable, automated pipeline, under under the Single Cell Spatial Analysis Workflow (SCSAWorkflow) project aiming at analyzing single-cell spatial protein data of multiplexed whole-slide tissue images generated from technologies such as MxIF Codex and Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC).
This Python-based package leverages the anndata framework for easy integration with other single-cell toolkits. It includes a multitude of functional and visualization modules, test utilities, and is capable of running in user-friendly web interfaces. Spac offers insights into cell interactions within various environments, aiding in studies of the cancer microenvironment, stem cell niches, and drug response effects etc.

## Installation
